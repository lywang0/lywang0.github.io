👋 Welcome! I am an undergraduate student majoring in Electronic Information Engineering at [**Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST)**](https://www.hust.edu.cn), supervised by [**Prof. Peng Yang (杨鹏)**](http://faculty.hust.edu.cn/pyang/en). I will soon begin my Ph.D. studies in the Department of Computer Science at [**City University of Hong Kong**](https://www.cityu.edu.hk), supervised by [**Prof. Zhenjiang Li(李镇江)**](https://www.cs.cityu.edu.hk/~zhenjili/).

## Research Interests
My research focuses on **edge LLM systems** and **LLM serving systems**. I am particularly interested in runtime scheduling and system-level optimization of LLM inference and deployment, with the goal of enabling high-performance and resource-efficient LLM services on edge servers.
